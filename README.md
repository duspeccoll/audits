Resource metadata level audits for DU Special Collections and Archives

## Current Status

The frontend is just a placeholder for when the backend is cleaned up enough that I'm willing to push data to it.

The backend returns a *very* rough idea of what our Level 1 audit data will look like. It just returns the title and call numberfor each collection, and the total count of agents and subjects linked to it.

At the moment I'm only pushing this to GH so I can work on it while afk at work.
